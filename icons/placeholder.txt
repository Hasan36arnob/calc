This is a placeholder for app icons.

To create proper app icons for your calculator:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG icon with your app's design
2. Use an icon generator tool to create all required sizes:
   - 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512
3. Name them according to the manifest.json specification:
   - icon-72x72.png, icon-96x96.png, etc.
4. Place them in this icons/ directory

For a calculator app, consider using:
- A calculator icon with modern design
- Clean, minimalistic style
- High contrast for visibility
- Your brand colors
